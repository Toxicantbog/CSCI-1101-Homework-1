                <p>This is a project I worked on at the Frontera Hacks Hackathon. It is a 
                    <br>website made for small business to check resumes of applicants to see 
                    <br>if they match the requirements that their company is looking for
                    <br>from given some key words by the user.

                <p>
                    I made a unity project which projects a ball along a path which can be  
                    <br>affected by another object around it. It's movement is based on
                    <br>velocity method that unity has for objects.
